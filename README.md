# ReVoice (AI-enabled Smart Reviewer System)
The source code for [Revoice](https://revoice.tech), a working protoype for the idea. 

## The Idea
Today, millions of dollars are being used in the industry on customer reviews and customer satisfaction. Currently, the review mechanism expects a user to type in a text review and give stars/labels/score in accordance with his experience. This review then is stored in a database of the firm. The data analytics team then provides meaningful insights upon the customer experience.

## Our approach
We propose to use the power of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing to minimize the above mentioned process.
