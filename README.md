# ReVoice (AI-enabled Smart Reviewer System)

The source code for [Revoice](https://revoice.tech), a working protoype for the idea.

## The Idea

Today, millions of dollars are being used in the industry on customer reviews and customer satisfaction. Currently, the review mechanism expects a user to type in a text review and give stars/labels/score in accordance with his experience. This review then is stored in a database of the firm. The data analytics team then provides meaningful insights upon the customer experience.

## Our approach

We have used an ensamble model to classify text based reviews.
